\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank professor Quoilin first, for his mentoring during this thesis and his advices. Then Jade, for her collaboration on the linkings between the created model and MEDEAS.

Computational resources have been provided by the Consortium des Équipements de Calcul Intensif (CÉCI), funded by the Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique de Belgique (F.R.S.-FNRS) under Grant No. 2.5020.11 and by the Walloon Region. I am also grateful to the cluster administrator, M. Collignon, for his patience and valuable advices.

Thanks should also go to my mother, and everyone to which I talked about my thesis, what sometimes led me to get a new perspective on the work as I had to explain it in a new, concise and understandable way.
